# Epic2Cockatrice 

### Saving the .xml file
First you will need the .xml file for the Epic CG cards. Thanks to the ingenuity and generosity of @vjjft and @T6, members of the Epic CG Discord and the creators of epiepic.com, we have an easy to download ready made .xml file of all currently released cards. 

The URL for the .xml is: https://epiepic.com/api/card/cockatrice.xml

You'll need to save this page as XML only. If you save the whole webpage you might get strange artifacts that Cockatrice will spit out as errors later in this process. 

### Cockatrice
Next you'll need to download and install Cockatrice. As a disclaimer: my environment is MacOS. The steps I will describe work for MacOS, but might have slight changes for Windows and Linux operating systems. Keep that in mind as I describe what to do next. 

Download Cockatrice from: https://cockatrice.github.io/

Once downloaded install both Cockatrice and Oracle. You might need to run Oracle first to import the card database. When you run Oracle use the default URL. We will be adding Epic as an expansion later in the process. You should be able to hit next through the intial Oracle process without changing any defaults. Now you can open Cockatrice. 

### Importing Epic CG as an expansion
Once in Cockatrice verify that everything is working, all cards are imported, and that you have to ability to navigate to 'Card Database' -> 'Add custom sets/cards'. This will open a dialog box where you can navigate to the .xml file you saved from earlier. Select and open the .xml file. You should be all set now. 

#### Please let me know if you have any questions/comments/different steps for Windows/Linux.
